                The COVID lockdowns gave me an opportunity to pursue my curiosities, and Web Development had always been top of that list. I started by creating projects, and found myself easily spending six to eight hours a day on my projects and research. The more time I spent creating, the more I fell in love with the world of Development, and eventually made a decision to work on it full-time. 
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Going forward, I'm excited to learn more technologies, and continuously improve my craft. To showcase my skills, I have created a series of projects that are included in my portfolio. I am dedicated to continuously learning and improving my craft, and am eager to bring my creativity and problem-solving skills to the field of web development.
