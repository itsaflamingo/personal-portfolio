                    My name is Elizabeth, and I am a front-end, soon to be full-stack, software engineer. I have always been passionate about technology and the potential for creativity that has emerged as a result. I have spent the past four years working in pastry, where I fell in love with creating beautiful, detailed and functional desserts. During the COVID lockdowns I co-started a pastry start-up, and found myself really enjoying the process of creating a website. I decided to learn more about web development by creating projects. As I continued to create I slowly fell in love with web development, and decided to pursue software development as a career.
